/*
 * @classdesign The server interactor black boxes loading of a controller's model.
 * @discussion  The view controller should be coded only for the model it needs on the client.
 * This class is responsible for converting 'input' to 'controller model' asynchronously.
 * This does imply a data binding between the server response and the view controller.
 * It also means the view controller doesn't need to know how its model was obtained
